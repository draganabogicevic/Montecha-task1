# Montecha-task1

This is a task which I received as a technical part of the interview for a job application at Montecha.

The task was to create a "Connect the dots" game where the dots that are drawn on the canvas should be connected on button click.

In input filds the user should add info about dor (x position, y position, label are required, color and size are optional).

With info from inputs, dots will be drawn on canvas, and on clicking on the button "Connect Dots", they will be connected.
